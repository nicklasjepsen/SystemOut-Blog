## Introduction
For a hobby project where I created a "Magic Mirror" - more on that later on - I needed some weather information. I decided to go with [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) because they have a free plan, they have a nice HTTP API and a pretty simple model.

I thought that it probably wouldn't be the last time I would need to include weather data in one of my projects and there fore decided to write a generic Nuget package as a C# Universal Windows Platform class library. The reason for choosing UWP was that I needed to run the application on Windows Core IoT and also to make the Nuget package as usable as possible in future projects.

You can install the package in your own projects by running the following from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:

`Install-Package SystemOutWeatherApi`

If you just want to check out the source for the project, then go to [Github where I host the repository](https://github.com/nicklasjepsen/SystemOutWeatherApi).

## How to use the Nuget
Simply create a new instance of the `WeatherService` and provide the appId that you can acquire from [http://openweathermap.org/api](http://openweathermap.org/api)

Now some notes about the implementation...

## Paste as JSON in Visual Studio
First of I want to share the brilliant little function the devs at the Visual Studio team has provided us with: Paste as JSON, found in the Edit > Paste Special menu in VS.
The reason I'm telling you this, is because in this project, I needed to create a C# representation of the OWM data returned from their service, and that was pretty straight forward with this function.

### Note about localization
The Nuget currently only supports en-US and da-DK locales, but if you want to, go ahead an translate the strings in the Asserts folder in the solution. And if you do, please make a pull request so others can enjoy.

## The interface
The Nuget is just a simple interface wrapping some HTTP requests and de-serializing the JSON into .NET objects, here is a view of the code:

{{< highlight 	csharp >}}
public async Task<WeatherData> GetWeatherDataForCoordinates(string lon, string lat)
{
    return await weatherServiceProvider.ExecuteAsync($"{Uri}lat={lat}&lon={lon}");
}
public async Task<WeatherData> GetWeatherDataForCity(string cityName)
{
    return await weatherServiceProvider.ExecuteAsync($"{Uri}q={cityName}");
}

public async Task<WeatherData> GetWeatherDataForCity(string zip, string country)
{
    return await weatherServiceProvider.ExecuteAsync($"{Uri}zip={zip},{country}");
}

public async Task<WeatherData> GetWeatherDataForCityId(string cityId)
{
    return await weatherServiceProvider.ExecuteAsync($"{Uri}id={cityId}");
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Further then that it is just a matter of exception handling and making sure that the OWP API key is provided.

Remember to check out the [Nuget Site for the project](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SystemOutWeatherApi/) or simply install it directly in you projects:
`Install-Package SystemOutWeatherApi`
